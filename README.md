# Https-Spoofer

- My future project

#------------------

+ This app works on rooted phone and may find workaround to work on non root phone.

- This app can spoof network and system to think that target app has different package name, it is needed to use network promo from specific app.
* I think you don't understand it, in short
Telecommunications Network Sim provide a limited promo like unli data for 3days or 1gb fb for 2days.
This will spoof system and network for telco to think that the app was promo data app.

If you still don't understand, wait for next updates...
